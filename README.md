Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?


The Gaming Room was a client with a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It. The app was initially an Android app, but developers
at The Gaming Room sought to expand it with multi-platform functionality. This meant the designation of new dedicated server hosting
software.

In developing this documentation, I feel exceptionally proud of detailing the memory and storage management sections. I took great 
pride in detailing how much data I felt the game may be working with, parsing, sending, and receiving. I found working with a design 
document helpful while developing the code mostly due to the way the documentation laid out a large breadth of functionality. This
helped keep track of functionality I needed to make and what that functionality had to be capable of, kind of acting as an organized
checklist. This made development significantly easier. 

If I could revise a portion of the document, I would improve the Requirements and Design Constraints sections. I feel like they could 
be given more detail and refinement. 

I interpreted the user's needs largely by asserting ownership over the software's direction where the client's requirements were interpretable.
I had to be careful to consider the user's needs by considering things such as latency, client vs server relationships, data transfer, and the
end user's experience to a great degree to ensure a great experience. This is just my due deligence in ensuring I play my role in The Gaming Room's
success, and making sure my client is happy. 

I approached designing this software by doing research and investigating methods to implement my client's needs as well as the end user's needs. I
will certainly incorporate this methodology in the future. I will also look into tools such as the REST API and assess the needs in a similar way.
